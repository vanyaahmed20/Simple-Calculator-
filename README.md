# Simple-Calculator-
A simple Calculator has been created using the Assembly language.
# INTRODUCTION
This calculator can perform functions like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Percentage and power. Two new modes Increment and Decrement have been introduced in the Calculator. Which are rarely found in any calculator.
Different mnemonics and commands especially the use of loops and jump statements were beneficial in creating functions in order to run the code in a simple and efficient way.

# SCOPE
what was the purpose of creating this calculator?
The purpose for designing it was for the users to solve any type of problems. Rather than doing long calculations a user can simply use a calculator with unique methods to solve his problem within seconds. It is time efficient All this have been made easy because of Assembly language because, 
o	It allows complex problems to run in simpler ways
o	It is memory efficient.
o	Requires less instructions to get the results.

# LEARNING OUTCOME
The purpose of designing calculator was to do correct calculation efficiently. It should give user a relieve from doing the mental calculation and to need to rely on paper calculations.
